# BattleBrosRandomBroStart

Adds additional starting scenarios.\
From random backgrounds with random talents (stars).\
Making the start of each run a little more unique of an experience.

# Features
Four current new scenarios.
1. Random Brothers - Start with 3-4 level 1 brothers. At least 1 (sometimes 2) will be from slightly better than basic background. The rest will be from lowerborn or weaker backgrounds. Uniquely has a very small chace for the better starting brothers to be Adventurous Noble, Hedge knight, or swordmaster.
2. Southern Random Brothers - Same start as above but spawn next to a desert/southern city. Has southern varients in the spawn pool (plus nomads) and a small chance for unique spawn for assassin, gladiator, belly dancer, and crucified.
3. Random Rabble - Start with 3-7 brothers from basic, weaker backgrounds. For a more challenging random start.
4. Southern Random Rabble - Same as random rabble but spawn next to a desert/southern city and the pool of spawns has southern varients if possible.
